## About Fusilone

**Fusilone**, It is a local (offline) desktop automation system that enables device registration, maintenance/failure history tracking, and the generation of QR code smart tags. 

Unlike complex cloud-based systems, it **requires no installation** (Single-File EXE). It securely stores the entire database on the user's own computer. It is designed for small/medium-sized technical services, school laboratories, and those who want to professionally manage their personal equipment inventory.

## Key Features:

*  **Smart Tags and QR Codes:** It produces device-specific, compact barcodes with a resolution of 1050x600 that also display the last operation performed.
*  **Dark/Light Theme** Adhering to Material Design principles, it offers dynamic theme transitions that are easy on the eyes.
*  **Comprehensive Device Support:** All-In-One, PC, Laptop, Tablet, Gaming Console, Monitor, Mobile Phone, SmartBoard, Printer, Router, Projection
*  **Portable:** No SQL Server installation is required. The database (in `.db` format) is stored in the `My Documents\Fusilone` folder and can be easily backed up.
*  **Multilanguage:** It has the infrastructure for Turkish and English (localization) support.

* **Language & Framework:** C#, .NET 10.0 (LTS)
